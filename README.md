# Crystals Collector game


Crystals Collector is a game built using jQuery, HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started
 
- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

- This amount is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.

- When they do click one, the player's score counter is updated.

- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
