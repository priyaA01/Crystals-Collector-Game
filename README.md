# Crystals Collector game


Crystals Collector is a game built using HTML, CSS and jQuery.

Javascript function Math.random() is used for generating random numbers.


## How it Works
 
- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

- This amount is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.

- When they do click one, the player's score counter is updated.

- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

- The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

- When the game begins again, the player see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and  score counter) will reset to zero.

- The app show the number of games the player wins and loses.
